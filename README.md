# python_learning_curve

It is just a place to keep some interesting Python solutions and snippets :)

A lot of code here is from Hackerrank or Leetcode

I also put in some stuff to work with APIs using Python, Pandas, etc.

Some of the stuff is from freecodecamp.org - I have been a supporter for the last three years :)

Many tasks are solved puzzles from https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/preparation-kits.

Also, some of the items are from Amazon-like lists from Leetcode
