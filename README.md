# python_learning_curve

It is a place to keep some interesting Python code and functions :)

A lot of the code here is from HackerRank or LeetCode.

I also added some stuff to work with APIs using Python, Pandas, etc.

Some of the stuff is from freecodecamp.org - I have been a supporter for the last three years :)

Many tasks are solved puzzles from https://www.hackerrank.com/interview/preparation-kits.

Also, some of the items are from Amazon-like lists from Leetcode
