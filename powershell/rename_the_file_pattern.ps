.SYNOPSIS
Renames files in the current directory based on a specific pattern.
It replaces the part of the filename before the last underscore with a fixed prefix,
while keeping the part after the last underscore.

.DESCRIPTION
This script iterates through files in the current directory. For each file, it finds
the last underscore in the filename. If found, it constructs a new filename consisting
of the predefined prefix "SH ID_ Title_SH Controller Date_" followed by the original
part of the filename that came after the last underscore. It then renames the file.
Files without an underscore or ending in an underscore are skipped.

.EXAMPLE
PS C:\Path\To\Files> .\Rename-Script.ps1
If a file named "Controller Shift Handover_2311050901.log" exists, it will be
renamed to "SH ID_ Title_SH Controller Date_2311050901.log".
