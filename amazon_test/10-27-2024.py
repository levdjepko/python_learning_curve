''' Two questions were asked - the signal like [1,2,3,4,5] that needs to be sent via channels (e.g. 2 of them) such that we have the largest sum of medians of the arrays. 
Solution was to sort the array in descending order, then to use channels - 1 elements of them, and then calculate the rest of the elements in the reaminign channel, while also calculating its median.
#
The other question was about the amazon delivery and warehouses, it had an array of places where the deliveries must be performed, and d = x distance of max delivery distance
'''
# solved 1 14/15 (weird case 7) and 2 15/15
